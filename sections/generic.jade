  p The filter bubble is a social problem, not a personal one. The effect is the misinformation of the masses. Only through a collective effort we can measure the problem, understand it, and resist it.

  p The filter bubble is personal and subjective: You can't see it your own bubble because you're inside it. But, if you focus your attention on it, you can probably accumulate the knowledge to escape. By comparing your filter bubble with those of other users, you can start to understand the logic behind why Facebook penalizes or promotes certain content.

  p Censoring content through algorithms is much easier than taking it down: If certain content gets removed, this can be seen by everybody. Yet if certain content gets heavily penalized through the logic of the bubble, then it is only "the algorithm's fault":
    b It is the perfect technocratic scapegoat.
    | In such a case nobody is guilty. This project's aim is to act as a third party that is able to see how much and which content gets rarely seen by users.

  p By joining facebook.tracking.exposed, you can extract the meta-data of your Facebook timeline, and see in your personal private page how this is influenced. A open community of researchers can
    b analyze algorithm outcomes and keep Facebook accountable.
  | It will be hard, but it is only the beginning.

  p Done! If something is not working, tap here to get more support (TODO)

  p Now, when you open the Facebook page (only in the browser in which you have installed the above tools, not in the mobile app), you will send non-sensitive metadata to the project servers. You will have access to a personal page showing how Facebook messes with your content and how it categorizes information and posts. 
    b. TODO: Show some icon.


block vision

  p Researchers can use the API to do research on the Filter Bubble. 
    b No payment to access the website will ever be demanded
    | , but considering we are challenging one of the wealthiest concepts of the last decades, we have to try to distribute the effort through cooperation.

  p Structures with money can run their own server and offload mine. I want to make a public resource of what can be considered one of the secret powers of this Internet world. If you participate in the network, you will not have any special benefit besides knowing how much Facebook has tampered with your timeline. If you want to support us with a server, you will simply have faster access for conducting your research.

  p No private content is collected. No harm can be done to your Facebook account by Facebook. 
    b You are not violating the Terms of Service
    | , and this technology is not using the Facebook API. It is only extracting metadata (what|when|where|why) of what you see in your timeline. This way researches can then look for patterns and you will receive some stats (page still in TODO)

  p New developers can contribute to extracting more meta-data from the Facebook page. Scraping can be more reliable, look at the: 
    a(href="https://github.com/vecna/ESCVI") browser-side technology
    |.
  p.smaller Please note, I wish to pay developers, researchers, and advocates. But this project is zero-funded right now. Maybe I'll try crowfunding in the future, if someone wants to think about it, I'll provide Open Data on how the project is doing.
  p Advocates, journalists, and technimagicians: I want to localize these pages and leverage on local troubles to promote the tech (don't understand the start of the sentence), for example, from US you'll see this page that instead of raising the abstract problem of the Filter Bubble, raising the queston if Facebook is promoting Trump or Clinton (TODO). Every nation can be covered in the same way, tap here (TODO) to tell me about new political declinations (what do you mean by this).
  p Algorithms have to be explained and not treated as dark magic. Which are the variables considered? what weighs more in the final outcome? Algorithm discrimination will be a huge topic, and having ways to be understood by non-technical audiences is necessary considering the impact of algorithm on each one of us.

  p I'm in love with technopolitics, I believe in 2016 the goal of a cypherpunk is no longer "encrypt evertything". The power dynamics online have changed since the early '00. Now transnational corporation use

    |, the challenges nowadays are others.
  p Challenging the network monopolies, challenging massive profiling, and the business dynamics supporting this, is my primary concern now. Telco, Big Data industries, and nations are in a fight against themselves. This offers a new opening for users, in this chaos, we have to at least guarantee the preservation of human rights on the Internet and challenge abuses when they arise.
  p It is clear that institutions are not fast enough to catch up with corporate activities in the ditigal age. This action is composed by a mix of technology, political activism and psycology of the networks. Is completelty transnational, because a SocialNetwork monopolist is a global problem.

  h4.harsh The harsh truth ;)
  p I do not have the capacity to look for funding. I'm (mostly) a technician, and writing funding requests is not exactly my best way to invest time. If you believe in this project, consider tipping here (TODO donation page), or do some kind of fundraising.

  p The Filter Bubble is more of a social issue than a personal issue: You can spend effort to escape it, and actively keep in mind that it exists, but this is a minority questioning what they are perceiveing (what does the last sentence mean or relate to?). 
  P Society is undefended against an entity that can influence our learning process, so
  p What I want is: to have only chronologically unfiltered content. The decision of which algorithms, visualisations, correlations, suggestions, and meta-data will happen lies on the client's side. User choice.
